# Economizer
Looks up air quality data and modifies an HVAC outdoor air economizer function during wildfire events.
This uses a Raspberry Pi, relays, diode bridges and DC voltage regulators to alter economizer function. The equipment operates with 24VAC power for mthe unit.

Benchtop prototype is fully functional. Working on a wireless version to control multiple RTUs from one RPi.

My first open source project and learning tool for python.
